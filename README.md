# Curses_Engine

#Play in your terminal

Curses Engine is an open-source game development framework using the ncurses text-based UI library. 

This is a personal project spawned from a desire to learn ncurses for a CL-based text editor. This is an excercise for learning not only the ncurses library, but game design and basic engine architecture as well. Contributions are welcome (just excuse the mess).

If development continues on this project, I will likely include a development tutorial to help people interested in learning ncurses (you'll just have to look at the code for now).

Project files are slowly being reorganized. An ideal implementation/Design pattern is still not official. 
The current plan is to include some games to showcase the engine. The current game being developed is a space invaders clone. The player's "ship" is loaded onto the main screen. Movement and "shooting" are both available.

A basic interface with score and lives will soon be implemented, as will AI for enemy "ships".
